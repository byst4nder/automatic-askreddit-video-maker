This program does require a bit of a setup for it to run.

This is just a program meant for fun, if you actually want to use it for public usage, please ask me first.
This program was developed on windows and I can not assure you of its functionality on other OS'es.

Instructions on usage:
1.] Create a praw.ini file for the bot and place it in this directory. To do so, follow the structure from this image: (https://www.pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/redditbot3.jpg). If there is already a praw.ini file in this current directory, then edit the values to match those of your bot.
2.] Install all the modules listed in ./python-requirements.txt using python's pip module. EXAMPLE: "python3 -m pip install praw", and so on.
3.] Extract the file called ffmpeg.exe from the folder ffmpeg.7z and place it in this directory.
4.] Run the program. It should take about 5-10 minutes to render the video and then it will output a file in this directory.

If you have any questions or if this isnt working then please do raise an error on the github repo page.

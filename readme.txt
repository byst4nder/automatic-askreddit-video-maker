This program does require a bit of a setup for it to run.

This is just a program meant for fun, if you actually want to use it for public usage, please ask me first.
This program was developed on windows and I can not assure you of its functionality on other OS'es.

Instructions on usage:
1.] Create a praw.ini file for the bot and place it in this directory. To do so, follow the structure from this image: (https://www.pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/redditbot3.jpg). If there is already a praw.ini file in this current directory, then edit the values to match those of your bot.
2.] Run the program. It should take about 5-10 minutes to render the video and then it will output a file in this directory.
